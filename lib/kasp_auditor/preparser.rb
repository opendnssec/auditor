module KASPAuditor
    # This class reads a zone file, and transforms it to a form suitable to be
    # sorted by the OS sort command.
    # For purposes of sorting, each RR should be prepended by the reversed
    # domain name, followed by a separator (each label of the name is preserved
    #  - the labels are simply written in reverse order)
    # This allows the auditor to operate on a zone file which is essentially
    # in canonical order.
  class Preparser

    # @TODO@ Need to use different separator - difficult, since arbitrary data
    # can be encoded in name labels. Just have to hope we don't find a zone
    # with many vertical tabs in the names!
